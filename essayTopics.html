					<li data-theme="c">Knights are considered the closest one can get to nobility as they live by an honor code to uphold truth, freedom, and proper morals.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">When it comes to the telling of the tales the Knight also goes first.</li>

					<li data-theme="c">Though this is a common job at the time, and a job supported by the church the pardoner is not a respectable man by any means.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The pardoner is a sinner himself as he does his job out of greed not by churchly duty.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He admits his greed and is still unrepentant, he is even proud of his sin and that he takes advantage of others in the name of the church.</li>
