					<li data-theme="d">Nicholas devises a lengthy plan to have an opportunity to sleep with Alisoun</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He plays as if he is ill and delirious causing the Carpenter to come visit him</li>
					<li data-theme="d">While he is sick he tells the Carpenter of a vision he has of a great flood washing away all that lives</li>
					<li data-theme="c">His plan is to place three bath tubs on the roof of the house so that when the flood comes they can float to safety</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The night before the flood is supposed to happen the Carpenter, Alisoun, and Nicholas sleep in the tubs on the roof</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Once the Carpenter falls asleep the other two sneak downstairs and sleep together</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The following morning Absolon passes by the house and calls out for Alisoun in hopes of a kiss</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Alisoun is annoyed but agrees to just one kiss in the dark</li>
					<li data-theme="d">However she instead lets Absolon think he is kissing her when she is in fact kissing her bare arse</li>
					<li data-theme="c">When Absolon realizes what happens he is very upset and comes up with a plan for revenge</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He runs into town and grabs a hot iron poker only to return and ask for another kiss</li>
					<li data-theme="c">This time Nicholas sticks his arse in the way as a joke, and Absolon brands it</li>
					<li data-theme="d">In extreme pain Nicholas cries out for water which causes the Carpenter to awake on the roof above</li>
					<li data-theme="c">His arousal causes the tub to fall through the rook and into the house</li>

					<li data-theme="c">Her new husband was twenty years younger than her as he was 20 and she 40, and for this reasoning she holds some regret for the marriage, as he would not put up with the possessive treatment she used on her other husbands, and he also returned the favor upon her at times with abuse</li>

					<li data-theme="c">The friars are malicious men and she claims they rape women, and even though in the day of the incubi and fairies the incubi raped women, those days were much better because the incubi were respectful and at least got the women pregnant</li>

					<li data-theme="c">She gives him an opportunity to answer a question, whether he would have an ugly but loyal wife, or a young but unfaithful wife</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He responds by saying that she should choose what she thinks best for him</li>
